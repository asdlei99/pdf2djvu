freetype\\*.dll
===============
The FreeType 2 font engine is copyrighted work and cannot be used legally
without a software license. In order to make this project usable to a vast
majority of developers, we distribute it under two mutually exclusive
open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described below,
then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in any of your
projects or products.

- The FreeType License, which is similar to the original BSD license *with* an
  advertising clause that forces you to explicitly cite the FreeType project in
  your product's documentation. All details are in the license file. This
  license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General Public License.

- The GNU General Public License version 2, for programs which already use the
  GPL. Note that the FTL is incompatible with the GPL due to its advertisement
  clause.

The contributed PCF driver comes with a license similar to that of the X
Window System. It is compatible to the above two licenses.
