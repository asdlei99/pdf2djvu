To properly convert some PDF files in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages, the [poppler-data](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-data-0.3.0.tar.gz) package has to be installed.

For the Windows port:

  * unpack the archive;
  * rename the extracted directory to `poppler-data`;
  * put it into the same directory as the `pdf2djvu.exe` file.
